            <h3>🏠 Roots in Paracale</h3>
            <p>
                Born on December 10, 2000, in Paracale, where I completed my elementary education at Paracale Elementary
                School and high school at Paracale National High School. My journey then led me to Naga City for Senior
                High School at the University of Nueva Caceres.

            <h3>🎓 Academic & Athletic Balance</h3>
            <p>
                Recruited as a varsity tennis player at the University of the Philippines-Diliman, I spent two years
                balancing rigorous academics with competitive athletics. Currently pursuing my degree at Camarines Norte
                State College.

            <h3>📚 Beyond the Court</h3>
            <p>
                I'm passionate about historical fiction, which sharpens my focus and provides valuable perspectives on
                strategy and leadership—skills I bring into both teaching and playing tennis.

                        Recruited to play for one of the Philippines' premier universities. Two years of intense

                    <p>
                        After the pandemic, I returned home and discovered my true calling: coaching. Now at Camarines
                        Norte State College, I balance my studies while mentoring the next generation of tennis players
                        across multiple schools.
